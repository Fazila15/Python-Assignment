# Projects Repository
This repository contains multiple Python-based projects that are designed to help you practice various concepts, including control flow, list manipulation, and more. Each project is independent but contributes to building your overall Python skills. The projects include fun games, interactive applications, and practical utilities.

## Projects List
### 1. Index Game
An interactive Python game that helps you practice list operations such as accessing, modifying, and slicing elements in a list. It includes colorful console output using the colorama library to enhance the user experience.

Key Concepts: List indexing, slicing, modifying, user input handling, colorful console output.
### 2. Planetary Weight Calculator
A program that calculates a person’s weight on various planets in the solar system based on their weight on Earth. The program accounts for different gravitational constants on each planet.

Key Concepts: Conditional statements, user input, calculations, and rounding output.
### 3. Guess My Number
A number guessing game where the computer selects a number between 0 and 99, and the player has to guess it. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.

Key Concepts: Random number generation, loops, and conditional statements.
### 4. High-Low Game
A game where the player and the computer each have a random number, and the player must guess whether their number is higher or lower than the computer’s.

Key Concepts: Random number generation, condition checking, loops, and user input validation.
### 5. Mars Weight Calculator
A program that calculates the weight of a person on Mars based on their weight on Earth. The weight is calculated using the gravitational constant of Mars.

Key Concepts: Arithmetic operations, user input, and formatting output.
### 6. Countdown Timer
A countdown timer that prints a countdown from 10 to 1, followed by "Liftoff!" The program uses a loop to simulate the countdown.

Key Concepts: Looping, countdown timers, and simple user interaction.
